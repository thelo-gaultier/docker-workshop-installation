# Docker workshop
## Introduction

Tired of installing billions of software on your laptop to complete your school project? 
Want to learn how Google packages its applications? Do you want to win so much that you will be tired of winning? 
Or you simply want to look like a big nerd during your next date? Search no more, we got your back!
  
With our incredible Docker tutorial, you will learn how to build containerized applications that run on every platform 
regardless of its environment. Docker has probably been one of the most disrupting technologies 
in the past years thanks to the many advantages it offers in terms of deployment, 
software manageability, resource usage and scalability. If you can watch hours of “Funny cats video” 
seamlessly and without any disruptions or delays, do not thank Youtube, do not thank the cats themselves, - thank technologies like Docker.

In this tutorial, you will get hands-on experience with Docker. At the end you should be able to:
Create and manage containers
Build your own containers
Create multi-container applications
Be able to deploy and play with new software in seconds without polluting your laptop

## Preparation

You will save a lot of time if you install Docker on your laptop before the workshop. The tutorial is made for OS X and Linux.
We will provide you a virtual machine in the cloud to do this tutorial so everything you need is:
- A web browser
- A ssh client (if you have window you can use putty or mobaXterm, on linux and OS X you should already have it)
- A keyboard

If you go for this option <b> You do not need to install Docker</b>

But,

If you want to do the tutorial on your machine, feel free to do it. You will find below the instructions how to install Docker.

My recommendation would be to run Docker on your machine if you can ( so that everything will be in place if you want to play with it later).

See below what fit your need the best based on your OS:

- 1.1 Install Docker on Linux
- 1.2 Install Docker on OS X
