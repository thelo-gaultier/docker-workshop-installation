# Docker workshop

## Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to give you a glance of how application architecture has evolved within the last 20 years, and to introduce one of the most disruptive technology that has emerged out of this evolution : Docker.

Docker is an open-source project that automate the deployment of applications inside software scalable. “Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.” quote from Docker’s website.

Containers and Docker have been massively adopted over the last years because of many advantages they bring to the table in term of ease of deployment, software manageability, resource usage and scalability. For example, at Google, everything runs in containers. 

In this tutorial, we will get some hands on Docker and hopefully at the end you should be able to:
- Create and manage containers.
- Build your own containers.
- Create multi-container applications.
- Be able to deploy and play with new software in second without polluting your laptop.
